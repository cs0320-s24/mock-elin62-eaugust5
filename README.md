> **GETTING STARTED:** You should likely start with the `/mock` folder from your solution code for the mock gearup.

# Project Details
For this sprint, we built the beginnings of a web front-end application using HTML and CSS to set up a basic command-prompt interface, and TypeScript with React to organize components and process commands in that interface.


# Design Choices
We used a Map<string, string[][]> to map the name of a filepath to its contents. We also used switch statements to handle the following commands: mode, load_file, view, and search.

# Errors/Bugs

# Tests

# How to
In order to use the program, a user will first press the login button in order to be able to enter any commands. Once logged in, the user can enter the following commands: mode, load_file, view, or search. Depending on the mode (brief or verbose), their output will vary.
